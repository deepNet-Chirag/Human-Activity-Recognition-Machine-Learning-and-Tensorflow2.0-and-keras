# Human Activity Recognition Machine Learning and Tensorflow2.0 and Keras
This repository consist of code implementation for Human Activity Recognition using smart phone. We have implemented multi-class classification problem using both statistical and deep learning methods.
<br>
This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.
<br>
This dataset is collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone. This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually.
