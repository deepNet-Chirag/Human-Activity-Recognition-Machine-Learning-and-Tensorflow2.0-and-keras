# Self Driving Car using Tensorflow 2.0+ and Keras
This repository consist of code implementation for self driving car. We have implementation simple regression based ConvNet model.
<br>

# Library
 -Tensorflow 2.0+
 <br>
 -OpenCV Python
 <br>
 
# Architecture
Here, we have used Nvidea's self driving car architecture with some minor changes<br>
